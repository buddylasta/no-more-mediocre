# No More Mediocre
I'm sick and tired of being physically mediocre. No more. Use this web app to up your workout game, learn new skills, and challenge yourself!

## Purpose
This is one of my first react projects built from scratch. 

I learned how to:
- interface with airtable (database)
- migrate to supabase (database)
- use tailwind for styling
- and deploy with vercel

I also got more comfortable with react in general

## Tech Stack
- Framework
  - React
- UI Kit
  - Tailwind
- Database
  - started with Airtable
  - moved to Supabase
- Hosting
  - Vercel

## Updates
I will add workouts, skills, and challenges over time
